# Fabric Workspace Items

This directory contains all the Fabric artifacts for deployment to Microsoft Fabric workspaces.

## Structure

- **`config/`** - Variable library with environment-specific configurations
- **`ddl_scripts/`** - Generated DDL notebooks for warehouses and lakehouses
- **`extract/`** - Data extraction notebooks
- **`load/`** - Data loading notebooks
- **`lakehouses/`** - Lakehouse definitions and metadata
- **`platform_testing/`** - Platform testing notebooks
- **`warehouses/`** - Warehouse definitions

## Generated Files

Most files in this directory are generated by the `ingen_fab` CLI:

- DDL notebooks are generated from scripts in `../ddl_scripts/`
- Variable substitution happens during deployment
- Orchestrator notebooks are automatically created for batch execution

## Deployment

Deploy these artifacts using:

```bash
ingen_fab deploy to-environment \
    --fabric-workspace-repo-dir . \
    --fabric-environment development
```
